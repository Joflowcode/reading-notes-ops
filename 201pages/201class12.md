[Introduction to pfSense](https://turbofuture.com/computers/Introduction-to-pfSense-An-Open-Source-Firewall-and-Router-Platform)

Pfsense is a system that can create full featured routers and firewalls.

Pfsense has many customization options, and with it being open source can save time shopping around, and the high cost of networking needs.

There needs to be 2 network cards installed to use it. And pfsense is good for old pcs since it is light on hardware. (For homelabs 1gb ran is sufficient for example)

If prefer, you can pay for premium support, but it is designed for enterprise environments.

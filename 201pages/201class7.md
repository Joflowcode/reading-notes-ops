What is Powershell?

To quote the detailed defintion from article 
>PowerShell is a command-line shell interface made by Microsoft that enables system administrators and power users to manage computers from the command line. PowerShell is also a scripting language, built on .NET which can be used for automating administrative tasks and configuration management."

Powershell language is a powerful program that is meant to *do* vs create. Languages like JavaScript and Python will be used to create a program or website, but Powershell can deploy and manage them.

Previously Bash was only on Linux, and Powershell only on Windows but they both can run on the other OS now.

Some good reasons to learn Powershell according to artice are automation, accuracy, versality, the community, and its relevancy in the market.

This article was interesting as it informed that many attacks aren't using installed files, and relying on scripts. 

Malicious code can be put directly into the memory and not even touch the file system, and can evade security systems.

They can do furthur damage by logging into user other accounts to carry out more malicious work.

Knowing how much scripting is being used in attacks, this article shows me that Powershell is going to be really useful to learn in my career.

SOPs are critical in implementing or enforcing a policy. It is a way to keep an organization or team on track with their visions and goals. It helps create consistency as well.

Things to consider when writing an SOP: It should be

* Readable. This means legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, numbered paragraph headings, and effective use of whitespace.

* Consumable. Using a template or predefined format makes the content easy to read.

* Understandable. To be effective, SOPs must be focused and to the point, using relevant, but simple terms.

* Actionable. SOPs must clearly and succinctly describe what is to be done.
Measurable. The activities described within an SOP must be specific and measurable.


Before beginning it is a good plan to draft a flowchart and outline of the SOP scope.

**Five Guiding Principles** 

* Keep it simple
* SOPS must be portable
* Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story
* Consistency counts
* It's about the audience

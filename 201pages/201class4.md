It is important to ask the end user many questions regarding the issue. They may not know the technical terms, or even how to communicate what is wrong, but with discerning questions we can work with them to troubleshoot.

The article advises that we should consider all the possibilities even though often times the simplest solution is often the answer.

I like how it says to make a list, (good way to make a plan) and then start with the simplest route. If those fail, move through the other potential options.

After determining the problem, next we need to implement a solution. Depending on setting there may be complications such and may need multiple steps or specific times to troubleshoot.

An example may be someone needs their PC for an important work meeting, and a program they occassionally use is not working. The meeting takes priority so the solution would need to be implemented later.

After it is fixed and implemented, it does need to be tested to make sure it works.

Once confirmed working, document all the steps and process.

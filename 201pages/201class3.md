#### The Role of the Help Desk Professional

They are the face of the IT staff and it is a very customer service oriented role. Customers can be internal or external clients.

Help desk is usually the first line of support. I've done help desk work in the past. Depending on the organization and their IT dept department size and policy, help desk is often like the triage I consider. We would troubleshoot and solve basic IT errors, or assist clients with troubleshooting their systems. For escalated or higher priority or skilled issues, would be esclaated to a highered tier in the IT department that usually were not customer facing.

The Hard Skills Needed:
  * technical skils
  * security skills
  * troubleshooting skills
  * business skills

Soft Skills Needed:
  * communication skills
  * personal skills
  * writing skills
  * training skills
  * critical thinking

One help desk can be a stressful job if you let it. It requires patience and empathy for people. And also to not take it personal when someone is upset. They aren't upset at you. They are upset at the problem. Practicing de-escalation skills will prevent them from becoming angry at you.

I used to train in de-escalation skills to customer service reps.

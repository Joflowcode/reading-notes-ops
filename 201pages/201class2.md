[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

Github is a place tp store your online repositories (codes) and it has version control to keep track of any changes that are made (committed) to the code, and by which developer or branch. Makes it highly useful for collaboration.

Important sections to read are creating and forking repositories

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

VSCode is an incredible code editor, and runs on most OS and even has a browser version. 

If there isn't a built in language you can likely install an extension for it (like C++ or Java)

Live Server is a favorite because it helps get a good preview of what your code would look like executed.

Something to keep in mind is that sometimes VSCode is quite intuitive and may understand your code intention, but may not translate well ion the browswer. (For example, vscode will know a parent directory and load correctly in Live Share, but results vary when actually published live
)

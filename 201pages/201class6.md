Windows Security Center

[Windows Defender Security Center in Windows 10](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-defender-security-center)

WIndows Defender is actually a decent security system.

There are a lot of software updates across varying companies that I feel simplify and remove too many options for users, and even remove advanced options for advanced users. Or make them difficult to locate.

The Windows Defender update is one I actually feel is a significant upgrade.

It also makes sense to me that the manufactor of the OS will build a good security program for its system.

Especially with all the various options out there today. Mac are known for being more secure. And Chromebooks also have good security. 

Previously most users either had to invest in expensive anti virus and anti malware applications or face potential security consequences. Even if you used your computer responsiblity.

Window Defender also has a clean UI, and easy to read and understand options for average user. It also shows drive performances and health.

This is intuitive system done right, especially with the device driver troubleshooter in same area.

There are better options, but it is truly sufficient.

Eh, but I'm still not sold on biometric security features yet. But it is good that they include the more recent security options.
